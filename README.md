### README for Pong Game

#### Description

This project implements a simple Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles controlled by the players and a ball that bounces between the paddles and the edges of the game screen. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing behind your paddle while trying to score points by making the ball pass behind your opponent's paddle.

#### Features

- **Game Screen**: The game screen is set up with a black background of dimensions 800x600 pixels.
- **Paddles**: Two paddles (`paddle_a` and `paddle_b`) are drawn on the left and right sides of the screen, respectively. They can be moved up and down using the keyboard keys (`w`, `s` for `paddle_a` and arrow keys for `paddle_b`).
- **Ball**: A square ball (`ball`) starts from the center of the screen and moves at a constant velocity (`dx`, `dy`) in both x and y directions.
- **Score**: Scores for Player A (`score_a`) and Player B (`score_b`) are displayed at the top of the screen using a turtle (`pen`).

#### Libraries Used

- `turtle`: For drawing graphics and implementing game functionalities.

#### Installation and Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
   - No additional libraries beyond the standard Python library are required.

2. **Usage**:
   - Clone the repository or download the Python script (`pong_game.py`).
   - Run the script using `python pong_game.py`.
   - Use the following controls:
     - **Player A**: Use `w` to move paddle up and `s` to move paddle down.
     - **Player B**: Use arrow keys (`Up` to move paddle up and `Down` to move paddle down).

#### Gameplay

- The game starts with the ball moving towards Player A.
- Players move their paddles to hit the ball back to the opponent's side.
- Points are scored when the ball passes behind a player's paddle.
- The game continues until the players decide to quit.

#### Contributions

Contributions to enhance the gameplay, add features (such as sound effects or AI opponents), or fix bugs are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
